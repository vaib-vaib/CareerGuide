	          <p>Engineering and medical are very competitive career these days. 
		To apply for each of them there are different entrance exams like MH-CET and NEET for engineering and medical respectively. Getting a good college is dream of every student preparing for these exams.
		After lot of efforts and hardwork student appear for these entrances. But when the results are out many of them are actually clueless about what to do next. Thus they usually appoint for various counsellors
		 who advises the suitable college for the particular rank of student at a considerably expensive cost. 
		</p>
		<p>
		So we are developing a project which could determine all the applicable colleges for a particular rank. On providing rank achieved by the user and other necessary information all the colleges for which the student
		 could apply with the provided rank would be displayed on screen.
		Thus, these could help saving a lot of money as well as time by the student and also give accurate information of applicable colleges thus acting as a career guide.
